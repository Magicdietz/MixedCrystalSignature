# Mixed Crystal Signature
Program to locally classify crystalline structures in 3D pointcloud data as retrieved from moleculardynamical simulations, colloids or complex plasmas.

# Features
- Calculation of a feature vector for local classification of crystalline structures as described in [Dietz et al.](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.011301)
- Training of a neural network with artificial crystal lattices of fcc, bcc, and hcp
