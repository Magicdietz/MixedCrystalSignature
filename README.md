# MixedCrystalSignature
Program to locally classify crystalline structures in 3D pointcloud data as retrieved from moleculardynamical simulations, colloids or complex plasmas.

This repository is still incomplete

# Planned features
- Calculation of a feature vector as described in this [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.011301)
- Training of a neural network with artificial crystal lattices of fcc, bcc, and hcp
- Examples and a Tutorial

# Planned Dependencies

 - Numpy
 - Scipy
 - Scikit-learn
 - Multiprocessing (Optional)
 - Numba (required, planned to be Optional)

# Heavy WIP
